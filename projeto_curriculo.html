			<h3 id="PRESENT"> OBJECTIVE </h3> 

				<p> Hello there. I go by many names, but my real name, as you should've guessed by now, is Obi-Wan Kenobi. I was once a respected Jedi who had a very high level at the now deceased Jedi Order. Since Order 66 was released not many Jedis survived to tell the story. So here I am now, looking for a new job to fullfil my life's purpose. I'm looking forward to finding a new hope. </p>
